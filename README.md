TODO
----
- [ ] individual uploads of files / progress meters
- [ ] loading indicator when doing something with files (disable stuff) (delete is WAY too slow)
- [ ] remove book removes ALL files (slow)



Wireframes. Consult with UI person? Or just make it however and go?
Finish data model / admin interface so he can add files


ADMIN TOOL
----------

Genre creation and selector. Just a string (not an id)
Author: just a text field. 
Search (testing)

DATA MODEL
----------

Books can have both text AND audio. But you're buying BOTH. We don't want it to show up twice in the store though. 
- add mp3s AND text files?
- need a way to show it is mp3 and text without needing to check the attached files.
  -- update the type when you add files. set flags
  audio: true
  text: true



LAME STUFF BEFORE LAUNCH
------------------------
Really good metrics
Security: creation / deletion routes. Accessing content.
